# Pali

Pali is a simple Thread Pool library for Python. It is compatible with Python3 as well as Python2.

Pali can be used for:
- Creating Data Pipelines.
- Handling requests in Messaging Brokers (on the top of TCP/IP layer).
- Simulating any stress testing systems.
- API Testing systems.

Pali is simple to use. Test cases in repository(https://github.com/gitvipin/Pali/tree/master/tests) show different ways in which ThreadPool instances can be created and used.
